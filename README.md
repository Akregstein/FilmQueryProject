# FilmQueryProject

#Overview

The Film Query project is a program that implements components of a database with the purpose of allowing user input to select, sort and display various components of database tables.

I designed an application that allows users to choose from a menu of options and is set up to display various information about films based on that that users input. The user is prompted to either enter a keyword or the id of a film and then the films title, description, release year, rating, language and actors are displayed.

#Technologies used
This project utilized many new technologies for me. It required the merging of SQL commands to access columns in a table within the database and then java code to pull that data information into the programs output.Imports used for the first time during this project included Connection, DriverManager and PreparedStatement.

#Lessons learned

This was great practice in incorporating SQL query statements within a Java program. While I feel that much was learned through this exercise I  still feel I need more repetition before I will feel as confidant as I am with other elements of Java programming. I intend to read over the course materials from this past week in hopes of filling in the gaps that I felt a little unsure of my actions during this project.
